# Safe_Walk
This website allows citizens to log and report issues and problems encountered in public areas.

The goal is to raise public awarness and address concerns for individuals who feel unsafe while walking alone.

By clicking on any location on the map where such an incident occured, a form will appear where details of the issue can be recorded and stored. These reports will be marked on the map as unsafe areas, providing valuable information to aid in making informed and safe decisions when navigating these areas.
